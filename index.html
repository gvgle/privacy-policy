    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to **The hardest jumping game** (the "App").</p>

    <h2>We Do Not Collect Any User Data</h2>
    <p>
        The App is designed to provide a pure gaming experience with no user data collection. We do not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information (such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers).
    </p>

    <h2>We Do Not Share Data with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not collect any data, we do not share any data with third parties. We do not use analytics tools, or any other third-party services that could track user behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        All your game progress and data are stored locally on your device. The App does not transmit this data to any servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any updates.
